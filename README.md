## Why I Built This

I spend a lot of my day staring at terminals and dashboards. I wanted a small, tactile thing on the desk that could show me what my PC was doing without me having to alt-tab to find out — CPU temp during a long compile, what's playing on Spotify, calendar at a glance — and let me poke at it with real keys instead of yet another window.

The other half of the motivation is the stretch. OakBridge is the first project where I deliberately scoped a hardware → firmware → host-software stack end-to-end, all on parts I hadn't used in anger before: ESP32-S3, LVGL on a real display, FRAM for state, and a Python companion talking over MQTT. The point is to do the whole loop once, badly, and have a tangible thing on the desk afterwards.

The name is a nod to **oak wood** (the planned enclosure) and a small shout-out to **Oak Ridge National Laboratory**.

## Initial Requirements

The table below tracks the design intent against what will ship on **v1.1** (the DRC-fixed respin currently in fab, expected back end of May 2026). The first soldered board — **v1.0** — never powered up; see [Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned-the-0mm-via-incident) for the story. Until v1.1 lands, all power-up-dependent outcomes are honestly marked **TBD**.

## Why X over Y

A handful of decisions on this board that had real alternatives. Capturing them here so future-me remembers the trade.

**ESP32-S3 over ESP32 / RP2040.** The S3 has native USB (no CH340), enough SRAM + PSRAM to make LVGL pleasant, hardware vector ops, and WiFi + BLE on-chip. RP2040 would have been cheaper and easier to program but every wireless feature would have become a bolt-on. ESP32 (original) lacks native USB and is starting to feel its age for new designs.

**FRAM over EEPROM or flash-only.** State on this board (last screen, brightness, key bindings, MQTT credentials) gets written often enough that flash endurance is a real concern, and EEPROM is too small / too slow for anything beyond a few config bytes. FRAM is essentially RAM-fast, byte-writable, and rated for 10¹³ writes. Worth the few extra dollars.

**MicroSD + FRAM, not just FRAM.** FRAM holds *state*; SD holds *content* (UI assets, fonts, logs, image slideshow). Different access patterns, different lifetimes, different sizes. Keeping them separate keeps the firmware honest about what's small-and-precious vs. large-and-replaceable.

**TLV1117LV33 LDO over a buck.** Total budget is ~400 mA at 3.3 V from a 5 V source. Worst-case dissipation is (5 − 3.3) × 0.4 ≈ 0.7 W — comfortable for a SOT-223 with a copper pour. A buck would have been ~10–15% more efficient at the cost of switching noise on the analog encoder input, a bigger BOM, and an inductor. Not worth it at this current.

**2-layer board, not 4-layer.** Cheap to fab and the signal count is low enough to route on two layers without pain. The trade I made — and paid for — was that USB differential routing on a 2-layer stackup is fussier than I respected. See [Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned-the-0mm-via-incident). MkII may go 4-layer just for the routing comfort, not because anything on this board needs it electrically.

**Cherry MX2A over original MX.** The MX2A generation has smoother factory lubing and a quieter sound profile, and the footprint is drop-in compatible with classic MX. Same keycap ecosystem, slightly nicer feel.

**Touch fanned out but unused.** The Waveshare 3.5" comes with capacitive touch on the same FPC. I fanned the touch lines out to the connector but didn't wire them into firmware for MkI. Wanted to keep the firmware scope tractable; physical keys are the primary interaction. Touch becomes a v2 / MkII concern.

## Firmware

**Status: not started.** Waiting for v1.1 boards to arrive before writing a single line. The plan below is the design intent, not a description of code that exists.

**Framework:** ESP-IDF v5.x
**Location:** `firmware/` (currently empty)

**Planned scope:**

- **Display:** LVGL on top of the Waveshare SPI driver, double-buffered, target 30+ FPS on simple screens.
- **Input:** software-debounced switches; quadrature decode for the encoder; long-press / multi-press detection.
- **Storage:** FRAM holds runtime config (brightness, current screen, key bindings, MQTT credentials). microSD holds fonts, icons, and any image assets.
- **Connectivity:** WiFi station mode, mDNS responder as `oakbridge.local`, MQTT client to a user-configured broker, embedded HTTP config server, OTA over WiFi.
- **PC link:** MQTT topics — `oakbridge/stats` (incoming PC metrics), `oakbridge/media` (now-playing), `oakbridge/commands` (outgoing key/encoder events). QoS 1.

Firmware build and flash instructions will land in [`docs/firmware_guide.md`](docs/firmware_guide.md) (planned).

### PC Companion

**Status: placeholder.** No code yet. The repo has a `companion/` directory reserved for it.

**Plan:** Python 3.8+ daemon that collects CPU / GPU / RAM / temperature stats via `psutil` and `pynvml`, reads media-player state via MPRIS on Linux, and publishes everything to MQTT for OakBridge to render. Linux first (my daily driver); Windows / macOS later if there's appetite.

---

## Setup & Bring-up

(Filled in after v1.1 boards arrive and bring-up completes.)

**Planned bring-up sequence:**

| Step | Action | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Power on via USB-C, no MCU loaded | 3.3 V rail measures 3.27–3.33 V, no thermal events |
| 2 | Probe ESP32 strap pins at reset | BOOT/EN behave correctly, no unexpected boot mode |
| 3 | Flash a minimal "hello UART" firmware | CDC-ACM enumerates, serial output visible |
| 4 | LED smoke test | Each of LED1–LED5 lights when driven |
| 5 | Switch + encoder smoke test | All 5 MX keys + encoder A/B/SW register |
| 6 | FRAM read/write test | Known-pattern write → power cycle → read back matches |
| 7 | microSD enumerate + read | FAT32 mount succeeds, files listable |
| 8 | Display init | Waveshare 3.5" shows colour bars |
| 9 | LVGL "hello" screen | First UI screen renders, encoder navigates |
| 10 | WiFi join + MQTT publish loop | `oakbridge/heartbeat` visible on broker |

Empty results table for backfill once boards arrive:

| Step | Result | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TBD | | |
| 2 | TBD | | |
| 3 | TBD | | |
| 4 | TBD | | |
| 5 | TBD | | |
| 6 | TBD | | |
| 7 | TBD | | |
| 8 | TBD | | |
| 9 | TBD | | |

## Lessons Learned: the 0mm-via incident

The v1.0 board does not work. It does not even power up — I haven't tried, because the failure is structural, not electrical.

**What happened.** When I set up the PCB design rules in KiCad, I left the **via drill diameter at 0 mm** in one of the via classes. KiCad's DRC would have caught this immediately. I skipped DRC verification before exporting Gerbers, because the layout was "obviously fine" — I had reviewed it visually and the renders looked clean. The fab took the files as-is, produced the board with pads where vias should have been, and shipped it. I soldered the whole thing before realising every via on the affected net class was just a copper dot with no hole through the board.

**What I'm doing about it.**

1. **v1.1 is in fab.** Same design, drill diameters corrected, going turnkey this time so I get a populated board back. Expected end of May 2026.
2. **DRC is no longer optional.** From now on, "DRC pass" is a step in my export checklist that has to be ticked before Gerbers leave my machine. I've added a one-line note to my KiCad project template.
3. **I review fab DFM reports.** Most fabs *do* run DFM checks and flag missing drills. This one didn't, or did and I missed the email. Either way, the responsibility is on me to verify, not on them to warn.

**Why this is in the README and not buried.** The whole point of these write-ups is to be honest about how the work actually went. The board is broken because I made an avoidable mistake. Documenting it costs me nothing and saves the next person (probably future-me, on a different project) from doing the same thing. It also makes everything *else* in this README more credible.

More detail in [`docs/lessons-learned.md`](docs/lessons-learned.md).

## When to Use This / When NOT to Use This

**Use this if you want to:**
- Build a tactile, mechanical-key dashboard for your own PC, on your own desk, with your own UI.
- Learn ESP32-S3, LVGL, FRAM, and MQTT together on one small board.
- Fork the design as a starting point for any "small wireless gadget with a screen and a few buttons" project.

**Don't use this if you want to:**
- A polished, validated, production-ready product. This is a personal learning project. v1.0 didn't power up. v1.1 is in fab.
- A keyboard. 5 keys is not a keyboard. If you want a macropad, the Cherry MX footprints are reusable but you'd be better off with a project actually scoped as a macropad.
- A low-latency input device for gaming. USB-CDC + MQTT has latencies that are fine for "skip track" and bad for "fire weapon".

---

## Roadmap

### v1.0 — soldered, dud (May 2026)
PCBs fabricated and hand-soldered. Discovered the 0mm-via DRC miss after assembly. Never powered up. Kept on the desk as a reminder.

### v1.1 — DRC-fixed respin (end of May 2026, in fab)
- Drill diameters corrected, DRC clean, Gerbers re-exported
- Turnkey assembly with the fab — boards arrive populated
- Power-on bring-up (table above)
- Firmware v0.1 — display init, switches, encoder, FRAM read/write
- Firmware v0.2 — WiFi + MQTT + first PC-companion round-trip
- Enclosure CAD (oak) — in progress, no committed date

### MkII — possibilities (much later, ~2027)

Not committed. Listing what I'd consider if I redesigned from scratch:

- 4-layer stackup for cleaner USB / display routing
- Capacitive touch wired into firmware (FPC fanout already exists)
- USB-C PD negotiation for higher current headroom
- Side-mount encoder for a flatter front face
- Independent RGB backlight per key (currently single-channel blue)
